## *lautils-mat*: Luigi Acerbi's utility functions for MATLAB

This is a collection of MATLAB utility functions that I wrote (unless otherwise specified), and that I share among a number of projects. Functions in the following list are consistently used. Undocumented functions in the repository might be untested/deprecated so use only at your own risk.

Functions are loosely divided in folders by category.

### General


### Optimization (./optim)

- *cmaes_wrapper.m*: A wrapper with a simplified interface for the CMA-ES algorithm (requires *cmaes.m*).

### Statistics (./stats)

- *qranddvm.m*: Quick discretised Von Mises distributed pseudorandom numbers (unused?).
